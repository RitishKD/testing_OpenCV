# testing_OpenCV
Hi folks!!! Here is simple object detection and real-time detection code in python using yolov3 in OpenCV.
I have also explained with comments in the code of real-time detection what is actually happening in the background. 
so even beginners can read and understand the code and create your own first objection detection project.
I have also included cfg files here.
